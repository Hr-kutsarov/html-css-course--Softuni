            Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the
            copies of <em>Nature, New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific journals her work had
            appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <em>On The Road</em>. It had been Molly's favourite book
            since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

            She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
            proclaiming that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do".
